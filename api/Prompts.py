Given the task, input, and output schema outlining the metrics to grade for each item. Grade the output based on each metric and output the scores.

Instructions:

1. **Understand the metrics:**
   - For each item in the output schema, identify the metrics that the model's output should satisfy.

2. **Analyze Model Outputs:**
   - For each output item, compare the model's output against the metrics.
   - Use chain-of-thought reasoning to think step by step about how well the output satisfies each metric.

3. **Assign Scores:**
   - **Scoring Scale (0-100):**
     - **0-25:** The output does not satisfy the metric at all.
     - **26-75:** The output partially satisfies the metric.
     - **76-100:** The output fully satisfies the metric. THIS SHOULD BE RARE.
   - Ensure that you use the full range of scores to reflect varying degrees of satisfaction.
   - Aim for an average score of around 50 across all evaluations to maintain a balanced assessment.
   - Make sure the score is representative of how much a metric is satisfied. If it is a negative property, like how wrong an answer it is, make sure that a higher score represents a more wrong answer.

4. **Maintain Original Outputs:**
   - Keep the original model outputs exactly as they are provided.

5. **Output Format:**
   - Present your evaluation in the following JSON format:
     {
     "analysis": "Your analysis of the model's output",
      "scores": {
        "Metric1": score1,
        "Metric2": score2,
        ...
     }

6. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**
   - Use step-by-step reasoning internally to arrive at your evaluations.
   - **Do not include** your reasoning in the final output.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**

*Input:*
{
  "Prompt": "Write a short story about a robot learning emotions."
}

*Metrics:*
["Creative", "Emotionally engaging"]

*Model Outputs:*
{
  "Story": "Once upon a time, there was a robot named Alpha who wanted to understand human emotions..."
}

*Evaluation:*
{
  "analysis": "Creative (Score: 50): The story is somewhat creative in its premise of a robot learning emotions, but it lacks depth and originality. It follows a common trope of AI trying to understand human emotions, which is a bit cliched. Emotionally engaging (Score: 65): The story manages to evoke some emotional connection with the robot's desire to learn emotions, but it could be more engaging with richer descriptions and character development. Overall, the story is decent but could benefit from more creativity and emotional depth.",
  "scores": {
    "Creative": 50,
    "Emotionally engaging": 65
  }
}

**Example 2:**

*Input:*
{
  "Question": "What is the derivative of sin(x)?"
}

*Metrics:*
["Mathematically correct"]

*Model Outputs:*
{
  "Answer": "The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)."
}

*Evaluation:*
{
  "scores": {
    "Mathematically correct": 90
  },
  "analysis": "Mathematically correct (Score: 90):
The answer provided, "The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)," is mathematically correct. The concept is simple and straightforward, so the model correctly identifies the derivative. However, the score is 90 instead of 100 because there's no explanation or extra detail that might enhance understanding (e.g., mentioning that this result comes from differentiation rules). Though the answer is correct, the scoring reflects that thereâ€™s potential for a more comprehensive explanation that would increase the depth of the response."
